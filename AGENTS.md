# Code Review Rules

## TypeScript

- No `any` types - use proper typing
- Use `const` over `let` when possible
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for objects

## React

- Use functional components with hooks
- No `import * as React` - use named imports like `import { useState }`
- All images must have alt text for accessibility

## Styling

- Use Material UI utilities only
- No hardcoded colors - use design system tokens

## Feedback

- Tell me how can resolve the issues with a code example
